I am a Senior/Staff Software Engineer with leadership and management experience. I have worked in healthcare tech, advertising tech or adtech, embedded systems, browsers, and as a web developer. I have formal education in Computer Science and Embedded Systems in the CS and EE departments.

My code is in production today and used by cardiologists in hospitals, to power Netflix advertising, by software engineers at Intel, Toyota, Jaguar Land Rover, Renesas and other companies in their autonomous technology research departments, and at large companies where I have led teams of developers.

I end up making developer tooling and automating things wherever I go.

I like C/C++, Linux, JavaScript, Verilog, and synthesizers and drum machines.
