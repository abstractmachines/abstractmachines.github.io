## Hi, I'm Amanda Falke,
### a software engineer in Portland Oregon.

I specialize in front end UI development for web and embedded systems, and have
some full stack and Linux skills as well. From AngularJS and Bootstrap sites
built with Atom and Webpack, to Qt C/C++ Linux native apps for the driverless
cars industry.
