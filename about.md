## Hi, I'm Amanda Falke,
### a software engineer in Portland Oregon.

[Portfolio Site](http://abstractmachines.net)
I specialize in front end UI development for web and embedded systems, and have
some full stack and Linux skills as well. I've worked on projects from AngularJS
and Bootstrap sites built with Atom and Webpack, to Qt C/C++ Linux native apps for the driverless cars industry. My code is in production today and used by software
engineers at Intel, Toyota, Renesas and other companies in their driverless
cars and autonomous technology research departments; I also have a lot of
code in production today from web projects completed as a front end web
developer.
