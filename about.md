I'm currently a Software Developer working on a complex cardiology app used in hospitals today, and an Embedded
Systems Computer Engineering student entering my senior year.

I previously worked in the driverless cars industry as a Software Engineer, and in app and web development before that.

 My code is in production today and used by cardiologists at hospitals, by software engineers at Intel, Toyota, Jaguar Land Rover, Renesas and other companies in their autonomous technology research departments, as well as by users of a lot of food and wine sites I made for national companies when I got started with my career.

 I end up making developer tooling and automating things wherever I go.

I like C/C++, Linux, JavaScript, Node, nginx, Verilog, Webpack, and synthesizers and drum machines.
