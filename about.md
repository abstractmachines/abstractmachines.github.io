I am a Software Engineer at Igalia working on the WebKit team. I have a passion for low level code and embedded systems. Previously, before my tech career, I was a professional musician.

I have worked in autonomous vehicles tech with embedded systems, cardiology tech, and as a web developer. I have formal education in Computer Science and Embedded Systems at university.

 My code is in production today and used by cardiologists in hospitals, by software engineers at Intel, Toyota, Jaguar Land Rover, Renesas and other companies in their autonomous technology research departments, and at large companies where I learned Kubernetes and led teams of developers.

 I end up making developer tooling and automating things wherever I go.

I like C/C++, Linux, JavaScript, Verilog, and synthesizers and drum machines.
